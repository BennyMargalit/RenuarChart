### Adding a Payment

When adding a new payment, you'll be prompted for:

- **Amount**: How much you owe
- **Due Date**: When the payment is due (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- **Recurring**: Whether this is a monthly/quarterly/yearly bill
- **Notes**: Optional additional information

### Recurring Payments

For recurring bills (like subscriptions), the app will:
- Ask if it's recurring and how often
- Automatically create the next payment when you mark one as paid
- Keep your payment schedule going without manual input

### Payment Status

Payments are automatically categorized as:
- **Paid**: Payment has been completed
- **Overdue**: Payment is past due
- **Due Soon**: Payment is due within 7 days
- **Upcoming**: Payment is due later

## Data Storage

Your payment data is automatically saved to:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\PaymentTracker\payments.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/PaymentTracker/payments.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/PaymentTracker/payments.json`

The data is stored in JSON format and can be backed up or transferred between machines.

## Tips for Best Use

1. **Add all recurring bills** as recurring payments to avoid forgetting them
2. **Use descriptive names** for payments to easily identify them
3. **Check reminders regularly** to stay on top of upcoming payments
4. **Mark payments as paid** immediately after paying to keep your records current
5. **Use notes** to add account numbers, confirmation codes, or other details

## Example Use Cases

- **Monthly Bills**: Rent, utilities, phone, internet, insurance
- **Subscriptions**: Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships, software licenses
- **Annual Payments**: Car registration, property taxes, insurance renewals
- **Quarterly Payments**: Estimated taxes, business expenses

## Troubleshooting

- **Data not saving**: Check if the app has write permissions to the data directory
- **Date format errors**: Use MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g., 12/25/2024)
- **Amount errors**: Enter only numbers and decimal points (e.g., 99.99)

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Email/SMS reminders
- Payment categories and tags
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Multiple currency support
- Payment splitting for shared expenses
- Integration with banking apps
